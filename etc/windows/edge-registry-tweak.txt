1.Open Registry Editor.
2.Navigate to the following Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DnsCache\Parameters

Tip: How to jump to the desired Registry key with one click.

3.Create a new DWORD value "MaxCacheTtl" and set the value to 1. This value indicates the TTL for positive DNS query responses. By lowering it to 1, it effectively disables the client-side DNS cache.
4.Create a new DWORD "MaxNegativeCacheTtl" and set the value to 0. This is the TTL value for negative responses. By setting it to 0, negative responses won't be cached either.
5.Restart your PC.
